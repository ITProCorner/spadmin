Awesome.</p>\r\n<p>Now I would like to set up a scheduler to obtain daily updates into the TermStore.&nbsp; Tried doing full import every night but the fields (custom list) binded to this termstore looses connection during fresh import and left grayed out.&nbsp; Would appreciate\r\n any feedback if someone found a way to get updates into the Managed Metadata. Thanks,</p>\r\n",
