I have a 3-tier farm with a mix of claims and windows authentication. No matter what I did the latest version would not find the term stores. I have 2, the default and one that I created for internal use. I tried on both the web frontend and also the application server.</p>\r\n<p>I then downloaded the previous Jan 28 2011 version and it works flawlessly. I agree, a hotfix might have broken functionality in the tool. I am running the same version sp ent farm 14.0.6029.1000.</p>",
