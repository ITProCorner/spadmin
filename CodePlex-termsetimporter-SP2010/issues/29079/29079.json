    "Description": "Hi,\nI have more than one Managed meta data services running (with different names of course). When trying out this tool and using the EXPORT function, it doesn't work. In each MMS I use different groups with different group names. When I enter the name of the group I get the message ' couldn t find group: <groupname>'. When I try it on a server with only one MMS configured, it does work.. So I figure it has got something to do with the fact that I have more than one MMS configured....\n-Peter vd Berg",
